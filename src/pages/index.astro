			<h1>Welcome to Stephen Mack's Sports Site!</h1>
<p>
				Welcome to the official <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> blog starter template. This
				template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build
				a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.
				As a lifelong athlete, I've had the privilege of competing at the highest levels across
				multiple sports. I've played soccer for the legendary **Leeds United**, ridden for the
				**Philadelphia Eagles**, and proudly represented the **Florida Gators**. When I'm not on
				the field, you can find me on the green as an avid golfer. This site is where I share my
				experiences, insights, and passion for the game.

This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
React, or Vue to your project.
</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code></li>
<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
</ul>
