Once upon a midnight dreary, while the Swamp sought victory,
Our Gators, once the kings of turf, now found themselves in misery.
For the Hurricanes, a swirling storm of green and orange dread,
Came to Gainesville, and in their wake, left our hopes for glory dead.

The pigskin, a fleeting phantom, slipped from hands that used to hold,
And the end zone, a distant pharos, a tragic, unwritten story to be told.
Each play, a mournful echo, a whisper of what might have been,
As the Hurricanes, with chilling ease, exposed our darkest sin.

A phantom-like offense, lost in a fog of despair,
Fumbled hope, and stumbled, caught in a nightmarish snare.
The roar of the crowd, once a thunderous might,
Became a funereal murmur, lost in the fading light.

From the first drive, a tragic omen, a premonition of our plight,
To the final, bitter seconds, lost to a dismal night.
The scoreboard, a tombstone, marked our fall from grace,
A hollow, haunting reminder of our team's disgrace.

And I, a fan, am left alone, with a spirit weak and sore,
To ponder this defeat, this shadow at my core.
Nevermore, the cheers of victory, nevermore, the promised crown,
For the Hurricanes have come to the Swamp, and cast our spirits down.
